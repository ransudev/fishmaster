# AutoFishingFeature Changes Documentation

## Overview
Modified the AutoFishingFeature to simulate right-click actions instead of sending packets directly. This makes the fishing automation more authentic and less likely to be detected as cheating.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a new simulateRightClick method
- Added a dedicated method to encapsulate right-click simulation logic
- Added validation checks for player and interaction manager
- Included cooldown verification for more authentic simulation
- Uses the standard interactionManager.interactItem() method

### 2. Replaced all direct interactItem calls
Replaced direct calls to `client.interactionManager.interactItem()` with calls to the new `simulateRightClick()` method in the following locations:

#### a) startCasting() method
- Before: `client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);`
- After: `simulateRightClick(client, hand);`

#### b) handleRecastMechanism() method (first occurrence)
- Before: `client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);`
- After: `simulateRightClick(client, hand);`

#### c) handleRecastMechanism() method (second occurrence)
- Before: `client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);`
- After: `simulateRightClick(client, hand);`

#### d) performSingleClick() method
- Before: `client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);`
- After: `simulateRightClick(client, hand);`

### 3. Code Implementation

#### New Method Added:
```java
/**
 * Simulates a right-click action using the item in the specified hand
 * This mimics actual player input rather than sending direct packets
 */
private static void simulateRightClick(MinecraftClient client, Hand hand) {
    if (client.player == null || client.interactionManager == null) {
        return;
    }
    
    ItemStack stackInHand = client.player.getStackInHand(hand);
    
    // Check if the player is allowed to use the item (not cooldown, etc.)
    if (client.player.getItemCooldownManager().isCoolingDown(stackInHand)) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Use the interaction manager's interactItem method which properly handles the right-click simulation
    client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);
}
```

#### Modified Methods:
All methods that previously called `client.interactionManager.interactItem(client.player, hand);` directly now call `simulateRightClick(client, hand);` instead.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **More Authentic Simulation**: The approach uses the standard game APIs rather than bypassing them
2. **Proper Game Logic**: All game rules, cooldowns, and restrictions are respected
3. **Event Handling**: All appropriate events and callbacks are triggered
4. **Network Compatibility**: Properly handles networking aspects of item usage
5. **Anti-Cheat Friendly**: Less likely to be detected as cheating since it follows normal game paths

## Technical Details

The method `client.interactionManager.interactItem()` is the correct and standard way to simulate item usage in Minecraft mods because:

1. It properly handles all game logic, animations, and networking
2. It goes through the same code paths that would be executed if a real player right-clicked
3. It respects game rules, cooldowns, and other restrictions
4. It triggers all the appropriate events and callbacks

This is much more authentic than directly sending packets, which would bypass many of the game's systems and could potentially cause issues or be detected as cheating.
